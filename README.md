# File-Handling

1)Extension Wise:-

We all know that to organize all this files manually.
It's so boraring and time taking task so first off all.
We need to import the required modules.
So import os and shutil module.these are inbuilt modules, so don't need to install them.
And you need to create a variable called path which takes input of the directory path that you want to organize.
And then create a variable called files.
Which consists of a list of lines.
Now write a for loop condition.
Using for loop we traverse through every file from files.
The we spilt the filename and extension of the file.
We only need an extansion name so we remove the dot from the extension through slicing.
And then we need write to if statement.
If the extension directly already exits, then we move the file to that directory.
In else statement we make a new directory and then we move the file into it.
At the last lets runs the program......
After that you get your all saparate file in their respactive folder............



2)category wise:-

Category wise is also like extantion wise.In extation wise folder name is given by there
extation and in categary wise folder name is given by categary wise.
first import os no need to install.than givebasepath for file path.than give whitelist after
that we will give if condition.In if condition we have to give category wise folder name
like image,video,pdf etc.then give for loop for every category folder.after that give for
loop and take if condition in the for loop.after that every category wise folder will take
place....Then run the code.....!
